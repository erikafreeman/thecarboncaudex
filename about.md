Caudex. A stem or rootstock of a plant. Here I try to index a collection of thoughts and collate, disseminate, and share understanding of the root, or caudex, of the carbon cycle and the carbon problem on planet earth.

This webpage also contains several short essays and how-tos on other (mostly) related topics including: microbiology, botany, electronics, coding, remote sensing, the philosophy of science, logic and reasoning, statistics, and the occasional interlude of real-life stories, opinion and ethnobotany.
