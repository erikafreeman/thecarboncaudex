I"U<p>The Carbon Caudex is a collection of writings by Erika C. Freeman and colleagues that discusses the story of Earth’s carbon. We don’t know how much carbon the Earth holds, nor do we fully comprehend its fluxes and storage. We have characterized millions of carbon compounds, yet we have only just begun to explore the richness of carbon chemistry. There are many fundamental biological and ecological mysteries that remain inextricably linked to the behaviours of carbon.</p>

<p>Caudex. A stem or rootstock of a plant. Here we collate, disseminate, and share understanding of the root, or caudex, of the carbon cycle and the carbon problem on planet earth.</p>

<p>This webpage also contains several short essays and how-tos on other (mostly) related topics including: microbiology, botany, electronics, coding, remote sensing, the philosophy of science, logic and reasoning, statistics, and the occasional interlude of real-life stories, opinion and ethnobotany.</p>
